CLINIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Navigate to the Repository:

Go to the GitHub repository where you want to create the issue.
Access the Issues Tab:

Click on the "Issues" tab near the top of the repository.
Create a New Issue:

On the "Issues" page, click the green "New issue" button.
Title and Description:

Provide a descriptive title for your issue. The title should succinctly summarize the problem or feature.
In the "Write" tab, provide a detailed description of the issue. Include any necessary information such as steps to reproduce the problem or details about the feature you're requesting.
Formatting and Adding Content:

Use Markdown to format your text. GitHub supports Markdown, so you can add headers, lists, code blocks, and more to make your issue clear and readable.
You can also include code snippets or error messages using code blocks (enclose the text in triple backticks ```).
Labels, Assignees, and Milestones:

On the right side of the issue creation page, you can assign labels to categorize the issue (e.g., bug, enhancement, documentation).
You can assign the issue to specific team members by selecting them under "Assignees."
If your project uses milestones, you can associate the issue with a milestone to organize and track progress.
Preview your Issue:

Before submitting, preview your issue to ensure the formatting looks correct.
